Cobalt is a Python toolbox from [BluelightAI](https://bluelightai.com/) that
helps illuminate and improve AI models. It uses [Topological Data
Analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01236) (TDA) to reveal
interpretable patterns in the ways a model fails or succeeds.

The time you have to understand and fix your model’s errors is limited,
expensive and hard to scale to the size of your dataset. Cobalt automates the
otherwise painful step of looking for patterns in how your models are
performing. We're here to make TDA easy to use.

### Cobalt Setup
